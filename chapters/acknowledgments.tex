\addchap{Acknowledgments}

I am indebted to the authors of the R Wiki Book (\url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming}), from which I took (in adapted form) some of the very basic introductory material about R.
In general, the statistics and R blogosphere and the \textit{CrossValidated} community have contributed significantly to my understanding of statistics and the R programming language.

For valuable advice on several occasions, I would like to thank the statistical consulting team of Freie Universität Berlin, fu:stat (\url{http://www.stat.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html}).

I am also grateful to the participants of many university courses I taught at Freie Universität Berlin as well as workshops I taught elsewhere (including Göttingen University and Siegen University).
Among the students in my statistics classes, Elizabeth Pankratz, Johanna Rehak, and Samuel Reichert provided the most valuable feedback through well-informed, inquisitive, and critical questions.

Finally, I would like to thank Felix Bildhauer for an ongoing discussion about statistical methods and their application in linguistics.
This includes the ``Dahlem statistics reading circle'' and a shared repository of books and papers about statistics.
